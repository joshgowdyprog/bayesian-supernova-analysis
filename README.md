Bayesian analysis of astrophysical supernova data and cosmological modelling. We construct a probabilisitc model of the data and compute the posterior distribution to estimate the hubble parameter and density of matter in the universe. In order to estimate parameters and build summary statistics
we must sample from our model posterior which we do so using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling via Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm.
